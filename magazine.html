Their dedication to social work reflects their belief that true knowledge extends beyond classrooms—it is about making a difference. By embodying the spirit of Goddess Saraswati, these students continue to serve as beacons of hope, fostering a brighter and more inclusive future through their selfless efforts.</p><br>
